            "Checking stories cross country, in California, police arrested Rodney King for suspicion of driving under the influence. You remember, King was brutally beaten by officers during a traffic stop in 1991, a case that sparked the infamous riots just a year later. In Woonsocket, Rhode Island, police say a college cheerleader may have saved his own life by using a tumbling move after falling four stories off a building. Dylan Smith did a backflip and landed on his feet. He suffered a broken pelvis. And take a look at this stash that FBI agents said they recovered in Whitey Bulger's Santa Monica, California apartment. In all, 30 weapons including hand guns and automatic rifle, even a grenade. Then there's the cash. More than $800,000, mostly in Benjamins stashed away in the wall. That will give you an idea of the power that Bulger yields, but incredibly he's asking for a public defender. Bulger has a rich, influential brother, Billy, a former state senate leader and one time the president of the University of the Massachusetts. So far the judge has not ruled on Bulger's request. Holly Hughes, an attorney, legal commentator and also former prosecutor. When you hear about this, the guy's got the money. Does it matter?",
            "Well, he doesn't technically have the money anymore because the state has seized it. It's something we called active forfeiture under the law. When you find money that you believe are the proceeds of a criminal enterprise, the state can start proceedings to seize that money and keep it and so what he is saying is, if you all give me back my $800,000, I'm happy to pay for my own lawyer. But what the state is saying clearly it's not just what you had on you. They are pretty sure he's got money stashed all over the place, but if they can't prove it, Kyra, and he fills out what we call an affidavit, which basically means I'm too poor to hire a lawyer. You guys have to pay for it, and you guys, as the taxpayers, if he swears to it on a financial affidavit and the state can't prove otherwise, guess who is footing the bill?",
            "So no matter how much outrage there is over this. I mean, this guy can stash as much money as he wants anywhere, we still -- could pay for this guy.",
            "And that's what's going to happen. We're going to end up rewarding his bad behavior. We're going to give him a prize because he's a good criminal. He has stashed away money, no doubt about it. He was found with $800,000 cash and over 30 guns. This man knows what he's doing. But if we can't prove there is other money besides what the government seized, yes, the taxpayers are going to be on the hook for that bill, much as it sticks in our craw.",
            "Well, it's interesting. You know, there were a lot of talk about -- was it a big deal they got this guy, they were old, these crimes happened so long ago? Really, was it worth the money to go after him? And then you see these pictures, which are incredible, of all the weapons that were hidden behind the walls, the cash -- I don't know if we can bring these pictures up again. There they are, right there. Grenades, guns --",
            "Yes and what we really have to refocus on, and we sometimes lose sight of this, there are 19 alleged murders. So what we're talking about is 19 families who have been waiting all these years for justice. This man has been on the run for 16 years. He has alluded authorities, so if we were to sit down with any one of those family members and say, was it worth it, we know what they're going to say. Of course, it was, we want justice. We want our day in court. This man murdered our loved one, our father, our mother, our sister.",

We'll have that story. And the president of Mexico, Felipe Calderon says he has a personal interest in pushing amnesty for illegal aliens. Calderon on American soil saying he has friends and relatives living in this country illegally. All of that, all the day's news and much more straight ahead here tonight.",

There is an industrial base, a lot of rural voters, which would tend to look at Senator Clinton favorably, but then also what is unique here the northwest part of the state, about 20 percent of people who live in that portion there, the Chicago media market, that is where that is based and essentially that would indicate or favor Barack Obama, the Illinois senator. Either way you take a look at this, Lou, it is going to be very competitive.",

            "And, Lou, the Clinton campaign says that it is well on its way to fund-raising, $10 million in the last 24 hours since the Pennsylvania primary results were announced. They say this is really historic grassroots for them. Obviously her campaign has been struggling to raise that kind of money that quickly. It is some 60,000 donors, they say 50,000 of them are new -- Lou.",
            "Suzanne, thank you very much. Suzanne Malveaux. Senator Clinton's victory in Pennsylvania illustrates the huge challenge that now faces Senator Obama.

            "It's not whether blue-collar voters will decide, Barack Obama he's not one of us. He doesn't care about us. He doesn't understand us. He has different values. We're going to go to the Republicans the way we did 20 years ago. That could happen.",
            "But Barack Obama sees a silver lining.",
            "Among all these groups that people have been focused on, you know blue-collar workers or you know white working class folks, we did better in Pennsylvania than we did in Ohio, so we're continually making progress.",

Senator McCain today declared he wants the support of Democrats and Independents, as well as Republicans.

            "So yes, I think it is -- those are elitist remarks to say the least.",
            "Now riding on his bus with reporters, McCain insisted it's not a contradiction to go after Obama on those so-called bitter remarks because he said Obama has really stood by the sentiment of that whereas he has really disavowed those controversial comments by his pastor, Jeremiah Wright. But Lou it really is a fine line for McCain because he has set the bar so high for himself when it comes to running what he called a respectful campaign -- Lou.",

Today the Pentagon announced that General Petraeus will be nominated as the next commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The Pentagon wants this promotion to take effort in late summer or early fall. General Petraeus will replace Admiral William Fallon who resigned amid speculation of his disagreements with President Bush on policy toward Iran. The Pentagon also announced that General Ray Odierno will be nominated to be the next commander of our troops in Iraq. Insurgents in Iraq killed four more of our troops, three Marines and one soldier; 35 of our troops have been killed so far this month; more than 4,000 of our troops have been killed since the war began, 4.047; 29,829 of our troops have been wounded; 13,309 of our troops seriously wounded. Up next here, a remarkable admission by the president of Mexico, Felipe Calderon, that may explain his sometimes aggressive pro-amnesty open borders agenda. Casey Wian will have our report -- Casey.",

Also, the Department of Homeland Security abruptly reversing course on its much ballyhooed virtual fence along our border with Mexico.

You know he's getting pressure from different sides here to come out and do more, say more. Particularly from Lindsey Graham is you know temporary golfing buddy, one time political foe here. When Lindsey Graham basically says to the president repeatedly, you've got to tell us what you're for, not just what you're against. Do you think it has any impact? Do you think it reaches the president? How do you think he would receive that message?",
            "Well, I mean, I think he has shown that he consumes news vicariously, like he takes it all in. And so, yes, I'm definitely sure that message got to him. But you know, how it impacts him, I think a lot of people impact him and the person that has sort of the most influence at times is the last person that talks to him. You know I had an interesting conversation with the voter on my way down here today. A woman, she voted for Hillary Clinton and I asked her, what do you think of what's going on? She says honestly, I think what's going on in Washington is the new normal. And you can't cure normal. This is who we are. The country is polarized and there's a level of expectation from voters that they look at this and say, this is what they do. At some point they are going to get it figured out.",

They are up against the House and Steve Scalise in the House said, look, whatever you guys decide in the Senate, basically, has no bearing on what we do in the House. His words, there were no commitments made in the House. They said nothing is going to make it through that allows any sort of amnesty, which is what he calls the path to citizenship for Dreamers and it doesn't include funding for border wall. So even if you get through the Senate, then what?",

The fact that Republicans have decided to tie this and call them illegal immigrants and really change the tone of the debate is problematic. And we're seeing that turn. We're also seeing Democrats turn on each other, which is even more problematic for the Democrats, where you know, they are angry -- the House is angry at the Senate for caving, activists are angry at Democrats in both chambers for what they think is not pushing hard enough, not going far enough. I would keep your eye on the State of the Union and see if there are any sorts of demonstrations, frankly, as a result of what's going on in the House and Senate right now. At Salena's point, one of the things \"The Daily Beast\" reported today is that the White House is actively trying to keep the president away from Chuck Schumer for that very reason that he tends to agree with the last person he spoke to. Since Chuck Schumer is pro-DACA and definitely different point of view from say, General Kelly and Steven Miller. They are trying to keep him away from the Senate minority leader right now.",

Then in May, he said 100 percent he was going to talk to the special counsel if asked. The special counsel is knocking on the Oval Office door right now. And he doesn't know what the special counsel knows. I think they are very nervous. I think this is a big cloud.

Whatever it is, whatever they find out, we want that conversation to happen because we're sort of tired of this cloud behind all of our politics and we want to see some sort of sense of normalcy in Washington. You know and see how he is as president without this. They have not had that opportunity, literally this Russian thing that's been a cloud over him since the day after he was elected. And if you like him, you want this to be behind him, if you don't like him, you want to see what happens and sort of what the findings are by Mueller so everyone sort of believes -- get this conversation over with so we can get on with some normal politics in Washington.

Listen to her response here.",

Also, he started railing against him according to the \"Washington Post\" about his wife running for office as a Democrat and the money she received, I think it was from Terry McAuliffe. So that conversation in and of itself, it's very indicative of this president. And it shows again, which we've seen, I think it used to be a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Justice Department. And now, it just doesn't seem like the president cares that the Justice Department and the FBI are supposed to be completely separate entity from the White House. And it -- you're seeing this kind of play out in the Mueller investigation. You have to imagine that he's either knew about this or he's watching it with great interest.",

They ruthlessly murdered dozens of people just at random. And until now, we have only seen what happened through still photographs, like this one. You remember this? And through the stories recounted by people who survived that attack. But now CNN has exclusively obtained some of the surveillance video from inside that Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. And the images are absolutely chilling. Much of the video, I just want to warn you, it's tough to watch. It's definitely not suitable for kids. So if you have little ones in the room, get them out. It is important, though, to show the depravity of these terrorists, their total indifference to human life, their lack of hesitation in ending it all together. CNN's Nima Elbagir has been going through hours and hours of this video and so today she reports on what we've learned about that horrendous Saturday less than one month ago.",
            "Shoppers at Westgate Mall. This is the scene moments before the al Shabaab attack. Suddenly, men, women, and children begin to run for their lives. This man on the floor thought he'd found safety. Wounded, he gathers the strength to try and crawl for help. Another gunman returns, without mercy. The security camera spotted two other attackers making their way to the top parking lot walking towards the children's cooking competition held there. Just beyond the camera's view, they open fire. This edited silent video obtained by CNN shows what happened during the attack in Nairobi on September 21st. As the attackers go through the mall, you see people desperate, trying to run and crawl to safety as bullets streak by. A body on the floor gets barely a glance, and another bullet. This is only a fraction of the surveillance video recorded during this day, most of it too horrifying to broadcast. In the supermarket, the hostage roundup has begun. A mother and her two children push an injured child in a shopping cart. A teenage girl follows, her hands in the air. She's bloody. A gunman points the way. Kenyan authorities say they closely watched the security cameras as the attack was happening. The hostage takers are spotted on the phone. Authorities believe they are receiving instructions from outside the mall. Here, one of them even appears to look for surveillance cameras. Only four attackers are seen in the video. There are long periods of time where they appear almost relaxed. At one point, the attackers take turns for prayers. Elsewhere, at a mall restaurant, a western man, gun in hand, and what appears to be a plain-clothed Kenyan police officer, take position to try to protect the staff and customers cowering behind a counter. And this was just the first day of what would become a four-day nightmare for Kenya. Nima Elbagir, CNN, Nairobi.",
            "Of all the video you saw, I am happy to report at least -- remember seeing the mother, she was pushing that cart with those children? There they are. She was seen in the surveillance video, including that teenage girl, they're OK. They were released by those terrorists. But the siege that went down inside that shopping mall for four long days with some shoppers held hostage, amid gun battles between the terrorists and then police, this brazen terror strike still raises questions about what are called soft targets, public places with relatively little security. Wallace Zeins is a form hostage negotiator with the New York Police Department and he joins me now. And, Wallace, just, first, I mean you sat here and watched this. Just your impressions of what we saw.",
            "Well, right off the bat, it was the theater of terror. You know, this was a typical terrorism attack, planning a soft target, going into the mall, getting as many people as they can get. Their objective is money, manpower, and media. They got their point across very easily. But if you look at the whole picture and you look at everything that took place, it falls into what the hostage situations are. The first 10 to 30 minutes of any hostage situation is what we call panic reaction. And that's what took place. The hostage takers are looking for a place where they can be comfortable. The military and the police are looking for cover and containment. And the hostages, they're running around, are trying to find cover. It's fight or flight.",
            "I'm curious because you mentioned media. And something we noticed. I don't know if you saw this. The gunmen, they're seen looking up at the ceiling, talking to - I don't know, talking on the phone to maybe their partners on the outside, perhaps people who were following the news, relaying those reports on the inside. I mean is that possible?",
            "Absolutely possible. And, you know, keep in mind, way back in -- remember the Olympics that happened with -- when Israel -- when the terrorists came in.",
            "Yes.",
            "The Munich Olympics. It was the same thing. It was the theater of terror. The hostage takers were the stars. The police and army and the hostages were the co-stars. And the world was the audience. And this is the point they wanted to get across to the world. And this took days. And they didn't care. Keep in mind, if they get killed, they are martyrs, you know, so they win one way or the other. But in the situation like this, there are steps that can be taken.",
            "What do you do if you find yourself inside?",
            "Well, if you find yourself, you've been taken hostage -",
            "Yes.",
            "One of the most important things, number one, you treat the hostage taker or takers as royalty. Number two, if you have any type of medical problems, let the hostage taker or takers know because they don't want a sick hostage. They want people that they can use. They don't want someone that's going to die on them and another charge added to them. The other thing, speak when you're spoken to.",
            "They're thinking about charges? Sorry, just had to --",
            "What I'm saying is, is that another situation could happen where they're going to be charged for that particular incident.",
            "OK. OK.",
            "The other aspect of it --",
            "Just quickly.",
            "Is that just treat them like royalty. And if a dynamic entry is made by the military or the police, hit the ground. Stay low.",
            "Wallace Zeins, thank you very much. Coming up next, the frantic search for two convicted killers on the run. Find out how prison officials were duped into letting these killers walk out of prison. We're on the case. Plus, the debt deal may be done. The fight, though, continues over Obamacare. Technical glitches have led to bad press. One question some critics are asking, is Health and Human Service Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to blame. Should she be fired?"

            "All right, a CNN exclusive on a Friday night. New reporting that describes a secret White House meeting between the President of the United States, Rudy Giuliani, and the two men now facing federal conspiracy theories and charges, all right. We know at least of those guys, you got Lev Parness, OK. He later bragged about his secret mission for the President in Ukraine. How did he get that idea, is it a legitimate idea? CNN's Vicky Ward is breaking this news. Vicki, thank you especially on a Friday night of being with us. Let's start with the assumption. President says, I don't know. I don't know what Rudy was doing with this guy, I don't know what's going on, ask Rudy. You say?",
            "I say my reporting shows that last December, Hanukkah Party at the White House, over 500 Republican donors, Lev Parness, Igor Fruman, the two gentlemen Trump claims not to know went with Rudy Giuliani into a room with the President where they strategized about a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine. This is the first time that we know of that the President directly talked to Lev Parness. This is according to Lev Parness, according to what he told two sources contemporaneously that Lev Parness, who speaks fluent Russian, Chris, would be tasked with going to Ukraine where he and Igor Fruman have contacts high up in the government to give them the President's message. Lev Parness talked about this as a secret mission, a crusade. He said, I'm working for the big guy in Ukraine in government circles. It was widely known that he had had this White House meeting that he was backed by the President.",
            "So Rudy's lawyer comes back and says this guy's delusional, this meeting never happened, I don't know why he thinks that. Why should we believe it did?",
            "Well, as I said to Rudy's lawyer, so how come Rudy Giuliani spent so much time with Mr. Parness and Mr. Fruman, and not only that was tied in with them financially? Furthermore, you do see this secret mission did start and actually in its early stages is quite successful. Lev Parness and Igor Fruman go to Ukraine in February, they meet with President Poroshenko, they tell Poroshenko, you need to start, you need to announce public investigations, and in return there'll be a state visit in the United States. And guess what, it worked, it all worked actually until--",
            "Until what?",
            "--because Lutsenko gives an interview in which he says we're going to start investigations in April. But it all goes wrong when the woman of the moment, Marie Yovanovitch who testified today is fired. She is fired as we know because Lev Parness and Igor Fruman and Rudy Giuliani pushed for her to be fired. They had financial interests that they perceived her to be an obstacle to. Once she's fired, it sort of like everybody finally woke up.",
            "And what does that tell you now in the new reporting?",
            "What does it tell--",
            "What is the new reporting tell us about what we should believe at this point?",
            "Well I think it's what's concerning about the new reporting is that it puts the President firmly in the Lev Parness and Igor Fruman camp much earlier than the July 25 phone call when he gets on the phone and there's talk of a quid pro quo. What it shows us is basically there was this idea of a quid pro quo what are we going to do in Ukraine back in December.",
            "Now here's the problem they'll have. Parness wants to speak, he has new representation, there's a whole story that you unearthed about why he and Fruman don't have the same counsel anymore. Let's leave it for people, they can read it online if they want. But the upshot is this, he wants to talk, he says he wants to talk to investigators. They are going to need to destroy Parness, which this President seems to like to do very much, where that's warranted or not. The problem is that, if they go after Parness too hard, do they risk throwing Rudy under the bus with him?",
            "Well, you are entirely right. Lev Parness really wants to talk to investigators and what the people--",
            "He was very insulted that the President said he didn't know him, and now when he got indicted that the President went bad on him.",
            "This is what's so interesting actually that at the end of the day, Lev Parness is clearly a sort of very emotional man that if the President hadn't said he didn't know him, he might not now have turned. I mean this was - I say in my article Lev Parness worshipped the big guy. (inaudible) Michael Cohen, Chris. They're all going to stand in line--",
            "Very charismatic man.",
            "Yes.",
            "--being that close to someone that powerful--",
            "Right.",
            "--can really bring strong feelings for people and make you willing to do just about anything.",
            "Right, until the President said he doesn't really know you, he's got nothing to do with you. And in the same way, the President sort of turned on Michael Cohen, the President turned on Lev Parness and now Lev Parness wants to stand up and tell his story. Rather like Michael Cohen, he's a flawed person, he's not got a perfect track record. But I think you're going to see that his counsel will argue, well just because someone's not a perfect person doesn't mean they haven't got a true story to tell.",
            "Now, it'll be very interesting to see how this story plays.",
            "Yes.",
            "But one person who will have to read it very closely, which many may not think, Ambassador Sondland, because this could be his future.",
            "Right.",
            "If he has one understanding of why he did and said what he did that now takes him to a different place with the President, he's going to want to read this story.",
            "He is.",
            "Vicky Ward, thank you very much for helping us understand what's in the morass a little bit better, appreciate it, have a great weekend.",
            "And to you, Chris.",
            "All right, there's an exclusive, you'll see it on cnn.com. Did Republicans just risk losing their biggest line of attack on the open impeachment hearings? I'm going to bring back in a GOP lawmaker who says if there's reason to impeach, he would. So, what would be reason to impeach, what is missing so far, what's he looking for? Next."
