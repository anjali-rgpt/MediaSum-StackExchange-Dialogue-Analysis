I mean, just a month ago we heard from two of these detainees in North Korea. They did a sort of short interview with AP Television, but it wasn't really shown in its entirety. It was these two sort of snippets; didn't get a whole lot of play. I personally don't even remember seeing this. And then it was as if North Korea didn't get enough attention from that. Now they offer CNN this five minute each sit-down interview, tightly controlled, obviously, but interviews with the detainees. So it's clear that they want to send this greater message now. And it seems like from what the detainees were saying, that message is right there. One of them saying, \"I'm getting desperate,\" another one saying, \"I need more help from my government.\" Hey, how about sending Bill Clinton. And then when you go back a couple of years, remember in 2009, there were two American journalists who were detained. They had crossed the boarded and then crossed back onto the Chinese side were still picked up by North Korean guards. One was Laura Ling, the sister of American journalist, Lisa Ling. And her family said later that Laura told them that she was told the only way that they would get released was if the U.S. sent Bill Clinton or some high-level envoy over there. Well, through working with the families, Bill Clinton did go over and the family said that he later told them that when he got there, the North Koreans wanted him to go on this big sight-seeing junket, to go to monuments and there was this stadium full of child acrobats that was set to perform for him but he declined. They wanted this to be a humanitarian mission, nothing diplomatic or nothing that would seem to be too chummy or playing by the North Korean's rule...","Of course, of course. So Kenneth Bae is the most well-known American being held by North Korea. He spoke to our Will Ripley also. He said he's in a labor camp. He works eight hours a day, he works six days a week but he did say that he's being treated humanely. Let's listen to what the appeal that he made to the U.S. government.","I do ask the U.S. government to send an envoy as soon as possible. And I think that's the only hope that I have right now in order for me to go home, and be reunited with my family. I do believe that the sooner that this get resolved, it would be better for -- not only for myself, but for the rest of the other Americans that may come in here in the future as well.","This is a real pickle, Peter, for the administration because when you hear Americans making a personal appeal saying, \"this is my last chance, this is my only hope,\" what's the administration supposed to do?","It's difficult. I mean I think what you've seen in the past is that the administration's -- because North Korea have done this many times -- is the administration's have has sent someone who is high-level but didn't have an official position, someone who they had some distance from because -- we also don't what the North Koreans are going to do, the North Koreans are unpredictable. And as we were talking earlier, you don't want to seem to be making concessions to them. But I think if you can send -- if you can send somebody who you have a relationship with but is not actually an administration appointee...","Such as Bill Clinton.","Well, or you know, Jimmy Carter has done that in the past, Bill Richardson, the former -- from New Mexico, the former administration official and the Clinton administration has gone many times. Has a relationship with them. Somebody who can negotiate but who you have some distance from, so you're not seeming to give the North Koreans exactly what they want.","Why do you think the North Koreans chose today to pull CNN's Will Ripley aside and say, \"Look, we have these exclusive interviews for you.\"","I don't know but I think one of the things we've seen with North Korea in the past is this tendency to feel ignored when there are other conflicts around the world. It's kind of this remarkable thing where I think the North Koreans want attention. They want various kind of support aid. Remember this a basket case economy that cannot feed its own people and has done various things to try to get the West's attention, whether it's talking about testing weap -- missiles or making threats against South Korea or now this, in order to get attention, especially when the West seems occupied with other things as it is certainly is right now.","In the interviews that we will play more of obviously throughout the program, there are portions that seem awkward, that seem peculiar, that seems scripted. Can we assume that these detainees were handed scripts by the North Korean officials or is it not that obvious, Peter?","Well, I would imagine that, you know, we knot they're being tightly controlled. Surely, they would not be able to say freely whatever they want, and that's why, I think one has to take, unfortunately, these claims of good treatment with a real grain of salt. We know that Kenneth Bae had serious health problems, that a person in with his health condition would be working in agricultural labor eight hours a day, does not strike me as particularly good treatment, and I think it only raise, you know, raises the level of concern about this really awful situation.","Peter Beinart, Michelle Kosinski, thanks so much for all of the information.

Back though now to IN THE MONEY at","America has the strongest economy in the world, but some experts wonder how long we can stay on top in an evermore global market. Our next guest doesn't think outsourcing is the main problem. He says the shrinking group of talented and educated Americans is the real danger. Not only are fewer young Americans going into the sciences, but those who do, have more and more opportunities to work overseas. Professor Richard Florida warns of America's brain-drain in his new book, \"The Flight of the Creative Class.\" He joins us to talk more about it from Washington, D.C. Welcome, professor.","It's great to be with you.","So the title of your book is interesting because we hear a lot about educational standards declining because of fewer students excelling in sciences and math. On the other hand, you are talking about creative. Is that a play on words, or can you explain that?","These creative people, the scientists, the technologists, the innovators, the entrepreneurs who built our businesses plus the people in the entertainment and financial industries are what power growth. In the United States and across the world, they compose about a third of the work force and get this, they account for about 50 percent of all the wages paid to people. So they are really the economic growth driver and they're going to generate the new jobs over the course of the next coming decades.","Richard, I think you were talking about being down in New Zealand with the \"Lord of the Rings\" crew and that people had a lot of American accents and all that and that was sort of a sign that people going overseas. But aren't those people just over there temporarily? I mean sure there are a lot -- Honeywell has people stationed in India. They are still Americans paying American taxes.","The main point of the book is not that Americans are leaving this country. It's that we have become critically dependant upon foreign talent because we're not producing enough of our own. The book says if we look at the Silicon Valley high-tech industries, 30 percent of those companies founded in the 1990s were founded by an entrepreneur who was born in another country. We wouldn't have Google, we wouldn't have Hotmail, we wouldn't have eBay in the United States, we wouldn't have Yahoo! or Sun Microsystems. We wouldn't have open source software here if it wasn't for a foreign-born person who came here to start those companies. What the book says is that what's really threatening America is now for the first time, those people have options elsewhere and even more worrisome, perhaps we are restricting their ability to get here in the first place.","In what way?","We have really, really put down some strong restrictions. I mean, I understand, I grew up in New York. I actually did a lot of work after 9\/11 with helping to re-shape thinking about the site. We have restricted, we've become overwhelmed with homeland security. We are restricting, you know, every visa officer lives in fear they are going to let in the next terrorist. But in reality --","Except for the ones that are in charge of the Mexican border.","That's a whole other question that we can get into. But the bigger threat that I think the Mexican border or outsourcing is the fact that the talent and the people that have driven our economy's growth over the past century are for the first time choosing perhaps not to come here.","Can you give us some hard numbers on how restrictive it's become post 9\/11?","We have seen about a 50 percent drop in visas granted. We've seen about a 30 percent drop in visa applications from those top-notch scientists and engineers and worst yet, the foreign students, a lot of this entrepreneurship in the United States come from people who come to MIT and Stanford and Berkeley and then go off and found companies. Foreign student applications are down by more than a third at our top universities. John Doerr, the great venture capitalist, always says, when a foreign kid graduates Stanford or MIT, we should staple a green card to their diploma and I agree with that. Instead we're telling them to go back to your country because we don't want you here.","Are you really sure because I mean, you go to a college campus, you see more foreign students now than ever. Maybe we are down a little bit from this high-water mark say in 2000. But say compared to five or I mean 10 years ago, aren't there just a heck of a lot more foreign students here?","Certainly since 1960. We have about 585,000 foreign students on our campuses which looks like a lot. But if you take the next four or five countries combined, they have about 750,000 foreign students. Australia, New Zealand, we mentioned that. The United Kingdom and these other countries are aggressively pursuing these kids. Plus, we can't count this out, the Indians and the Chinese who provide so much of our technical talent are saying the heck with you guys. We want to attract and retain our own best and brightest here and start those companies in Bangalore and Shanghai. The point of the book is nobody has to take over the whole ball of wax. But if we lose, 2, 3, 4 percent of the talented entrepreneurial people who used to come here to a bunch of countries, the numbers add up really quickly.","And the lack of ability to apparently produce our own students inadequate numbers who are interested in things like science and math. I was watching a commercial, I think it was for Exxon. Phil Mickelson was fronting it during the Masters Golf Tournament, suggesting that we are running out of kids in science and math who are going to be available to do the kinds of things that you are talking about and that we currently depend on a lot of foreign people to do. I suppose addressing the short-comings of the American school systems in conjunction with this conversation might be germane or is it?","No. We are out of kids. I mean we depend on foreign- born talent. Right now for 50 percent of all our working computer scientists, 50 percent of all our PhDs in the life sciences and 40 percent of our PhDs and you know what's even worse? Our scientific and engineering work force is a Baby-Boom work force. About 40 percent of those people are going to retire in the next decade or maybe two decades. We don't have a pipeline to fill the gap. So yes we have to fix our education system. But in the short run, we only have one place to look, this talented and entrepreneurial group of foreign people who have come and help build our country. If we cut back now as we are, we're going to face a critical deficit. Jack, the way I like to put it is, everyone on the Hill is concerned about the budget and the trade deficits, the twin deficits. I think this talent deficit produced by our schools that don't funnel kids into science, engineering, and worsened by the fact that we're clamping down on the one thing that has saved us, the foreign kids, who have filled this third deficit, is going to come back and bite us in a worse way than the other two deficits combined.","That is a scary image that you paint. Richard Florida, author of \"The Flight of the Creative Class, the New Global Competition for Talent.\" Thanks for joining us.","It's been great being with you guys.","There's lots more to come here on IN THE MONEY. Up next, making work feel less like work. We'll hear about a magazine that's out to help you land a job that matters.

Rush Limbaugh has turned in his resignation to the ESPN sports show. He did that after making controversial remarks about Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb. Here's what Limbaugh had to say about why he resigned. He says: \"My comments this past Sunday were directed at the media, and were not racially motivated. I offered an opinion. This opinion has caused discomfort to the crew, which I regret. I love 'NFL Sunday Countdown,' and do not want to be a distraction to the great work done by all who work on it. Therefore, I have decided to resign. I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of the show and wish all the best to those who make it happen.\" ESPN also issued a statement. Here's what it said. It says: \"We accept his resignation and regret the circumstances surrounding this. We believe that he took the appropriate action to resolve this matter expeditiously.\" In case you missed it, here's the comments last Sunday that started the whole mess.","You know, I think the sum total of what you're all saying is that Donovan McNabb is regressing. He's going backwards. And my -- I'm sorry to say this. I don't think he's been that good from the get-go. I think what we have here is a little social concern in the NFL. I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well.","Donovan McNabb himself held his own forum for the media. He says he can shrug off criticism about his play, but he was upset that Limbaugh made it a racial issue. McNabb conveyed the message that he'll stick to what he knows best.","I'm not here to judge anyone. You know, so, what was said was said. You guys make the decision if you feel it was racist or what should happen to him. You know, I'm a football player. I'm going to continue to play football, you know, with my skin color and, you know, with my muscular build, as you guys say, with my wife at home, you know. So, you know, I'm a football player, and that was my dream. My dream was to play football, play in the NFL, and I'm going to continue to fulfill my dream.","McNabb says he does not expect or need a personal apology from Rush Limbaugh. All right, we have reaction now. On the phone is the host of the Frank Ski Morning Show here in Atlanta. Frank, are you on the line?","I am right here with you.","You been getting calls?","Have we! Since Sunday.","You're kidding!","No, since Sunday. And...","So, people became immediately angry after hearing this on Sunday.","Because I think, you know, a lot of people are really tired of having race interjected in sports at all. I think if anyplace, you know, race needs to be let go out of the equation it's definitely in the field of sports, you know, which is basically based upon your athleticism and how you do the game and how well you play. And there is so much emphasis put on sports now to be a -- quote -- \"good citizen of sports.\" You know, play fair, play right.","Well, you know, but there is some sentiment out there -- there is some sentiment out there, Frank, that people are being a little too sensitive about this. Chris Berman (ph), I'm going to read you a quote from him: \"As cut and dry as it seems in print, I didn't think so when it went by my ears.\" He's talking about hearing Rush Limbaugh's statement while he was on the set with him. He says, \"As quarterback of the show, I feel bad about it. I don't think it was meant the way it came out. I don't think that defines the way Rush feels about people.\" Your response.","Well, I will tell you this: You know, Rush Limbaugh has made a history of being insensitive to people. So, I wouldn't say that that was necessarily the case. I think, you know, the hardest thing to find is when you become a host, whether it's to be a host of radio or be a host of television or a news person, such as yourself, sensitivity plays a big role. There are certain things we know we don't touch. One of the things you learn not to touch is to put race in the equation as to somebody's credibility in what they do. And I think that is what the whole issue is about. The...","Well, along that same line, Frank, this is what Limbaugh also had to say. He said, in essence: \"If people are so worked up about this, there must be some truth to it.\" He said that on his radio show in defense of himself.","I think some of the backlash could be as well the fact that a lot of people had a problem with Rush Limbaugh being a commentator for ESPN in the first place. And some people thought that that wasn't really the place for him. And the question that I would put out there is: Could Rush have gotten his point across without using the word, \"black?\" Could he have gotten across by saying that maybe some of the news media wanted to see Donovan do well and not necessarily use the word, \"black?\"","Yes, but wouldn't that have been being hypocritical? I mean, isn't it better that he come right out and say it?","No. Now he doesn't have a job because he said it.","Yes, but at least he's being honest about however insensitive his feelings may really be, isn't it better he be completely honest about it and get it out there?","Well, how would you feel if all of a sudden one of our stations, CBS here or CNN there, said, well, you know, I just kind of think that maybe we shouldn't have a black announcer on there, because blah, blah, blah? I mean, you know, certain things you just have to keep out, whether or not that's the way you feel or not. There are a lot of people in this country who are insensitive towards the plights of others or not emphatic, but that doesn't mean you need to say it in public, especially with the kind of impact that you have. Certain ones of us have to be careful about certain things we say, because our voice impacts so many. And I just personally think it was insensitive. Whether he should have quit or not, I don't know. But, I mean, he did what was best for him. And, I mean...","Well, I think he did what was best for","Yes, he probably did.","Because just because he says he resigned doesn\u0092t mean ESPN didn't push him along the way. We don't know that for sure.","You know, what's interesting is the other news coming out about Rush Limbaugh and whether or not that is the case. And it's kind of like once you get in that media bulls-eye...","Oh, we can't get into that.","Yes.","We can't get into that, Frank, because CNN has not confirmed it. So, we're going to stay away from that for now, but we want to thank you.","I appreciate it, though.","We appreciate your comments, too. One more question before you go.","Sure.","There were African-American commentators sitting on the set with Rush Limbaugh when he said this remark. Why didn't they say more about it?","I think -- my personal opinion is the same way it's done in a lot of places. I think it hit them, and it was such a big shock, because I will tell you, some of them are very vocal in what they say. But I think to an extent CNN (sic) has censored them in a way, of telling them, hey, listen, don't say anything, don't make this thing bigger than it is.","You mean, ESPN, not","Oh, yes, CNN -- I'm sorry. You're right, ESPN. Yes, I think they were censored in a way. You know, I think Michael Irvin would have jumped out on it in a New York heartbeat.","Yes, well, they were put in a hard spot, because, you know, you've got to play nice on the set with others, because sometimes that just makes you look worse.","You know, in the NFL right now on the field, you can get penalized for making a racial remark or an insensitive remark to another player on the field. So, you know if they're trying to crack down on it on the field, they're going to definitely try to do something about it on the broadcasts.","Well, we hope so.

Natasha Brown joins us now from outside of radio station KYW. Natasha -- welcome. I know there must be criticism for Donovan McNabb from fans. It's a tough sports town. But what are the fans saying about this?","Well, actually, we have been here all morning long at WIP sports radio, and they have definitely been talking about this latest revelation -- the alleged prescription drug abuse by Rush Limbaugh. They've been talking about it with fans. But, as you can imagine, and as you just mentioned, many of our fans, so passionate about football, they're more willing to talk this morning still about the racially-charged statement that Rush Limbaugh did make about Donovan McNabb. So, that is more of what we're hearing this morning. As I'm sure you know, Rush Limbaugh is here in Philadelphia this morning. He's set to be the keynote speaker at the National Association of Broadcasters convention, a three-day-long convention. He is set to speak at 9:00 this morning, and his comments are said to last from 9:00 to 10:15. We are, of course, going to be heading that way shortly, hoping to catch up with him, because no one has been able to get any comment that we know of yet about these latest revelations.","Yes, only -- yes. I guess I was going to ask you if people were going to go to protest while he spoke. Any word of that?","We haven't heard any word of that just yet. Again, many Philadelphians are still finding out about the \"New York Daily News\" article, and a lot of them are just finding out last night, from what we understand, about these latest allegations of drug abuse.

You're walking along with these protesters.","That's right, Carol. It's more than just the former appeal of the stand your ground law here in Florida.

They want the state to end war on children specifically they are mentioning zero tolerance policies in schools and communities across the state. They want to have an honest conversation about racial profiling. During this trial of George Zimmerman, there was a discussion of profiling, but they thought it should have gone a step further to also include racial profiling. Now there are about 15 of these \"Dream Defenders\" who stayed overnight, but the number have increased throughout the morning as the video you saw from yesterday. They got up to about 75. Expect that number to get to about 100 or maybe 125 today as through social media the tales of their movement is flowing.

This group, of course, disagrees and they'll be there as long as it takes to change it -- Carol.","Well, they may be there a long time because I just interviewed the co-sponsor of the \"Stand Your Ground\" and he said, yes, we can have a conversation about it, but \"Stand Your Ground\" had nothing do with the George Zimmerman trial. Nothing to do at all, in fact, it didn't even enter into the courtroom drama. It was only brought up afterwards.","I spoke with the Executive Director Ahmar about that. I said, is although it was part of the conversation, it was not part of the defense team.

He shouldn't have pursued Trayvon Martin, but in the final analysis, in the final struggle --","When the end came to the end --","He was justified.","He was justified in shooting Trayvon Martin.","At the bottom of our hour more exclusive interview with Juror B37. Why her blunt comments have prompted some of her fellow jurors to speak out and say, she doesn't speak for us. Also this morning, a squeamish overlap of crime and pop culture, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine is an icon in the music industry so is it giving the rock star treatment to an accused terrorist. Take a look at that. This morning, \"Rolling Stone\" is facing an online fire storm for this cover boy shot of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He is accused of carrying out the Boston marathon bombing along with his brother who was later killed during a police shootout. Erik Wemple is the media critic for the \"Washington Post.\" Good morning, Erik.","You're welcome. I know what the Twitter-verse is saying, but what do you say about this cover?","I think it's fabulous. I think it's great way to depict the suspect or alleged bomber in this case simply because all we know about him at this point is that he did, according to all his friends, all other witnesses interviewed after this terrible event said that he was a well adjusted sort of good guy, good guy to hang out with, party with and so forth and think this is journalistically accurate and quite frankly responsible.","So get ready for a firestorm to go around. I'm going to read a few comments. This is from Moracca. He's actually a CBS correspondent now. He said who knew \"Rolling Stone\" was the magazine for dreamboat terrorist boys. Here's another one from Boston radio host, John Dennis. He asked was \"Rolling Stone\" rag unable to find a picture of Hitler looking like a rock star. I mean, can't you understand that for the victims of this bombing that this would be disturbing?","I can totally understand that. This is a very fresh incident. It's a fresh and tragic and terrible, terrible incident but we have to remember a journalist's responsibility, responsibility of a magazine, is to portray the truth and the truth in this case is that, as I just said, that this guy was widely regarded as a well adjusted guy. How does he go from well adjusted high school student, wrestler, buddy of everybody, to a suspect or a perpetrator in this event? I think that is a very important question. I think the \"Rolling Stone\" puts it there for us right on the cover of the magazine.","Some people might say that \"Rolling Stone\" is glorifying the image of this handsome young man because you know there are a number of young girls or women for some bizarre reason or twist are idolizing this guy.","Listen, in terms of the photo availability of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Go ahead, Carol. Go ahead and look at Google images and see what you can play with. \"Rolling Stone\" did not alter this image. It took an image and placed it on the cover. I mean, what I think is going on here is a lot of the people who are upset out there are channelling a sense of responsibility -- are wanting to attach horns or iconography that turns him into a devil. I think the evidence against him does that amply. So I'm perfectly evidence happy with evidence presented today.","I know \"Rolling Stone\" does fine journalism, but it's known as a music magazine. What if it did have Charlie Manson on the cover like that, actually it did.","It took down a general, right. It took down Stanley McChrystal as we learned again from the death of Michael Hastings. \"Rolling Stone\" does an awful lot of long-form investigative journalism. It's covers politics heavily. It does this stuff. I think peple need to sort of not just about Justin Bieber and rap and rock. It's about a lot of things. And so they can do this, OK? \"Rolling Stone\" can go ahead and do this. You know, that they kick up a firestorm, I thing, is proper. That's the role of magazines to calm the question how we view people who did terrible things, how we view society, how we view crimes. That's the point of a magazine, I'm sorry, but if people have to start to think a little more deeply about what Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was or is or how he's evolved, I don't think that's a bad thing.","All right, Eric Wemple, thanks so much for sharing your thoughts with us this morning. We appreciate it. Thank you.","Appreciate you having me on.","A Russian lawyer helping NSA leaker Edward Snowden the fugitive will leave the Moscow airport in the next few days. His situation could be resolved within a week. As you Snowden officially applied for temporary asylum in Russia after being holed up at the airport for three weeks. But today Russian President Vladimir Putin says ties between United States and Russia are far more important than a fugitive scandal. Temperatures are soaring across the nation and the northeast is really sweltering. Highs over 90 degrees so combine that with humidity and it feels like a suffocating 110 degrees in some places. Here's CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons with more.","The heat is on. Dangerous temperatures are scorching much of the nation from the Midwest all the way to the northeast. The heat can be deadly. This year alone excessive temperatures have taken the lives of nearly 20 children left alone in hot cars. And amid all of this heat thousands of residents near Washington, D.C., are waking up to a water shortage.","It's hot, number one, and I'm concerned about personal hygiene and I have babies in the house.","Crews shut down a major water main for repairs last night. With temperatures expected to hit near 100 degrees this week, they're anxious to get that water flowing.","We suspect it will be from three to as long as five days for everything to be returned to the way it was.","And the scorching conditions aren't letting up along the eastern seaboard. At New York Citi Field last night thousands tried to stay cool at the Major League Baseball all-star game where temperatures soared into the 90s. Hot spots popped up all over the city. (on camera): Wow that's shot, 123 degree slide, yes, that's fun, that's 134 degrees steaming concrete in my face, 96 degrees, ouch. (voice-over): Temperatures in the 90s combined with humidity will make it feel like it's passing the 100-degree mark.","Hot, exhausting. There is sweat on just about every inch of my body so it's pretty gross.","I love her comment. But I guess, Indra, maybe the bright spot is the entire country will be dealing with this soon.","Yes. I mean, that appears to be what's going on. We see the spread all the way each into the Midwest. We're talking about major metropolitan cities here, Southern New England and New York. We know that stands right here in it. Now Philadelphia, and not even Ohio but Minneapolis. Can you imagine that? Minneapolis 95 feeling like 100 degrees with the humidity, I feel like a broken record when I say please don't leave your children or pets in the car and yet we just reported, 20 people. In 10 minutes you go from 80 to 100. We're starting at 95. You know what a death trap it is.","It's happened to me, I know. It's nasty. Indra Petersons, thanks so much. It's the case that's putting Florida's \"Stand Your Ground\" law under the microscope, but it isn't the Zimmerman trial. Coming up how one woman's use of deadly force that has people questioning stand your ground."],"40348":["Now major disaster along the Texas-Louisiana coast would also affect the      oil industry.  That could lead to a spike in prices on everything from      gasoline to groceries.  We reached energy expert David Purcell of      Pickering Energy Partners at his office in Houston.","In the Houston area, this      upper Texas Gulf Coast, almost 2.3 million barrels a day of refining      capacity in Houston, that's 15 percent of the US refining capacity.","This could be bigger than Hurricane Katrina in terms of      knocking refineries offline?","It could.  The difference between the Texas refineries and      the New Orleans-area refineries--we're above sea level for the most part.      The Barrier island change off the Texas coast are a bit more robust than      the Barrier islands offshore New Orleans, so what's impacted the refining      capacity in New Orleans with Katrina was massive flooding of the      refineries.  That is probably less likely.  That said, you could still      have these refineries down for three or four weeks if you have some      significant wind damage.","Now I suppose we should mention we're not just talking about an      oil industry; we're talking about a natural gas industry in your part of      the world.","Right.  And, in fact, if you think about the residual      impact from Katrina, we still have 7 percent of US natural gas production      shut in. We have another 7 percent of production at risk off the Texas      Gulf Coast.  So let's say even just a small portion of the Texas      production is impacted for two or three months, and you have a situation      where that limits our ability to get natural gas in the ground to meet      peak winter heating demands.","When oil and gas companies make their projections for the      coming months and years, do they assume that refineries and wells will      likely be offline for some period of days or weeks or months, depending      on the weather?","I'll say no, but  I think  the answer, if you're a Gulf of      Mexico producer, I think you have some average in there that says yes,      but that's like the old saying, `I have my feet in the oven and my head      in the refrigerator, and on average I'm OK,' right?  It's, you know, some      years there's a lot of production offline and other years you hit smooth      sailing. So it's really tough to model this and to predict it.","Can you lay out the state of the oil industry and the gas      industry and its inventories at this moment as this hurricane approaches?","Yeah, the state of inventories are OK.  We're close to      where we typically are at this time of the year, but with really six to      eight weeks left before cold weather really hits, that's a time period      where you really like to stock up and build inventories.  It's like the      bear, the squirrel who's trying to eat as much as they can before they      hibernate.  And with this production offline offshore, both oil and gas      production and refineries, the ability to kind of get that last little      bit in storage is really hampered here.","I got to tell you, Mr. Purcell, you seem awfully calm for a man      in the path of a hurricane.","Well, my wife would use a different adjective, I think,      but...","Because she went away...","Because she went away, so, you know, she's smart and I'm      not.","Well, Mr. Purcell, best of luck to you.","Thank you very much.","David Purcell is with Pickering Energy Partners.","You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News."]},"speaker":{"287256":["MICHELLE KOSINKSI, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT","ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR","KENNETH BAE, KOREAN-AMERICAN MISSIONARY","CAMEROTA","PETER BEINART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR","CAMEROTA","BEINART","CAMEROTA","BEINART","CAMEROTA","BEINART","CAMEROTA","MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR","CAMEROTA"],"143215":["VERJEE","CNN.
